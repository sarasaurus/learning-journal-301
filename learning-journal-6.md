**Journal 6**  
this week was challenging, I have work obligations outside of class pulling me in diferent directions and regardless of what I've actually done, it's been challenging to create enough mental space for both school and work. 

This weekend I worked on the ui challenge and the tried to get caught up with the readings.. I did some of the SQL excersises and that was helpful in light of the lab... so that I feel more confident with the lab, now in hindsight.  IT was distressing how challenging it sometimes was to get the syntax correct even with the example RIGHT THERE in the tutorial! The tutorial suggested testing out queries using:

SELECT * FROM tablename
WHERE conditions;

before attaching any actions... great idea tutorial!

Using the SQL shell is what got caitlin and I even as far as we got in Lab 09
thanks: \dt, \d tablename and 
COUNT (*) FROM tablename
WHERE condition;  

I got stuck on some dumb stuff in UI challenge, in the past I've used the elements section of the console extensively, just to see how big things are and what I'm selecting, I should have used that earlier this time... somehow I forgot all about it until I'd been stuck for way longer than 15 minutes.. pulled it up and unstuck myself in 5 minutes. Glad I got unstuck, but wish I'd remembered the console earlier.

Generally being able to test and experiement as I go, working incrementally and testing each step is so important... feeling challenged by the SQL shell and unsure of howto test (or not adequately testing via drop table) was a big part of what made lab 09 so challenging.
