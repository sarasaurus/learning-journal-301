day 2  
this week has been pretty stressful, didn't get much done over the weekend, didn't have canvas... starting the week already behind has been hard for my morale. 

Having labs in am is tough to achieve adequate breaks... I keep skipping lunch, or shortchanging it to turn in assignments.  I wonder if the point is for us to work together until a point and then finish assignments individually?

I'd like to find some balance this quarter, that doesn't leave me burnt out week after week, some way to make the weekdays a little more sustainable long term.
