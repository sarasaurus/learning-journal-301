__Learning Journal 3__

I think I need to review SMACSS, defintely not sure I get it.  would like to review the readings from this week as well, not taking my book home makes it a little harder to absorb the readings.. but I'd rather not carry it so..  
I'd love to go through my 201 notes to review them.

This week was definitely rough, hard to get back in the swing of things... 

Most of the concepts have been fairly easy to grasp... not really new concepts so much as syntax, so that has not been too challenging.    

As always the biggest frustration is trying to figure out whether my logic is the problem or my syntax is the problem.  I think having starter code sort of helps with that.  

 Also I think the codewars have been a nice review, I definitely find myself struggling to remember basic constructs like for, while etc... so as of this week, I think they are a good review tool.
