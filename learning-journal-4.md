journal #4  
this week looks like it will be conceptually challenging as we move from JSON single line local storage to using the ajax methods in jQuery. 
honestly I barely know what more to say about ajax, so this lab was enlightening.
we struggled with figuring out how much of the code to change and worked on console logging the information we didn't have.  I think this was a good move, helping us not get bogged down on trying to rewrite built in functionality.
codewars we definitely missunderstood the logic of the problem... I think in both cases remember to write things down in plain english and console logging anythign you do't get are both helpful strategies.
