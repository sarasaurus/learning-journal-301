the final test was challenging.. in part because of wording. I think I learned a lot while I was taking it, it was a good review of what we've done so far and helped me see some holes in my knowledge.

The questions a bout the model view controller were worded in a way that made them confusing... and the reading wasn't much help for that.

But some of the things I had to look up to answer the questions actually helped me with my assignment and helped me learn some new things.  Specifically the git question and some of the jQuery and SQL ones were a nice refresher.  We;ve been tacling things so fast I feel like I forgot all about jQuery dom manipulation as soon as we got handlebars, and I forgot about handlebars as soon as we started doing MVC stuff.
