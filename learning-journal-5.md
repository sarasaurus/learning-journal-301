had alot on my plate this week, and am hoping to feel more caught up after the weekend.
I think I understand the big picture of the MVC idea
that we have the browser making requests to the server.  The server can hand over http requests, but for anything having to do with a database, the server has to make a query to the database and get a response back before it can send a response to the browser.  The nodejs library? allows us to use javascript to interact with the server. Acting as both library and compiler?
