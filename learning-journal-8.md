This week has been challenging we had a lot of set up issues.  But I think I'm feeling more confident with my environment.  I've set things up to have two shells open which run my client side and server side, using live-server and node respectively.  Then I have a psql shell when I'm logged in to my local database so I can test out commands and test the effectiveness of my database queries locally.

I just talked with someone who showed me how to use windows plus the arrow keys to set windows to be quarter or half screen.

**SO FOR POSTERITY:**  
alt+tab to select  
then windows + l/r/u/d arrows to say 1/2 or quarter screen.   

_just a side note, cause we're talking about it:_  
you can also windows+twofinger swipe to switch between desktop views... still not sure how to take advantage of that--how would I use multiple dektops except for to loose windows into?*  

they also showed be the terminal in *vs code*.  so now I am thinking of maybe doing ACP in VS code terminal and then having SQL and server windows set to 1/2 and 1/4 screens.

I had  alot of trouble with *nodemon* this week, but I'm wodering if it was because I kept closing it to ACP.  I'm curious to try running it from a separate window and not trying to close it.  I bet it would work!

I think I will update my computer over break...
